⚡ ENERGY LOAD FORECASTING AND ANOMALY DETECTION

🌍 Short-Term Load Forecasting for Decarbonizing Buildings

This project was created for the India AI Impact Gen AI Hackathon to help visualize, forecast, and optimize energy consumption in buildings. It enables data-driven sustainability by combining load forecasting, anomaly detection, and actionable insights — all in one simple dashboard.

✨ Features

🔮 Load Forecasting :- Predict upcoming energy demand trends using historical building data.
📊 Interactive Visualizations :- Dynamic graphs to compare actual vs predicted energy consumption.
🚨 Anomaly Detection :- Spot unusual energy usage patterns that indicate wastage or inefficiency.
🌱 Sustainability Insights :- Estimate potential energy savings and show equivalent environmental impact (e.g., trees saved 🌳).
🖥️ Unified Dashboard :- Everything is displayed on a single-page dashboard for simplicity and impact.

💡 Why This Matters

🏢 Buildings contribute a major share of global energy use.
⚡ Optimizing short-term loads can reduce wastage.
🌍 Smarter monitoring helps accelerate the decarbonization journey.

This dashboard empowers facility managers, researchers, and organizations to:
✔ Identify inefficiencies
✔ Forecast consumption
✔ Take action toward sustainability

📊 Example Insights

✅ Predicted vs Actual Load Curves
✅ Highlighted anomalies (abnormal spikes/dips)
✅ Energy savings displayed as:

Potential Energy Savings: 250 kWh
Equivalent to: Planting 12 trees 🌳

🌟 Impact

Provides data-driven sustainability insights

Supports the vision of a low-carbon future

🔧 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/Vansh150705/Energy-Load-Forecasting-And-Anomaly-Detection.git
cd ENERGY-LOAD-FORECASTING-AND-ANOMALY-DETECTION
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

📐 How It Works

Data Ingestion – Reads building energy consumption data.

Preprocessing – Cleans & normalizes time-series data.

Modeling – Trains ML models for short-term load forecasting.

Anomaly Detection – Identifies abnormal patterns.

Dashboard – Visualizes actual vs predicted loads, anomalies, and sustainability insights.
